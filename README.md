# Deep Learning Assignment: Heart Ultrasound Scan Images Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on the application of deep learning techniques using ResNet101 and VGG16 architectures to classify heart ultrasound scan images. The dataset used for this assignment is sourced from Kaggle and consists of a diverse set of ultrasound images capturing different heart conditions.

## Objective
The primary goal of this assignment is to develop and evaluate deep learning models to accurately classify heart ultrasound images into predefined categories. ResNet101 and VGG16, renowned convolutional neural network architectures, were employed for this classification task.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle [Heart Ultrasound Images Dataset](link_to_dataset)
- **Description:** The dataset comprises a collection of ultrasound images depicting various cardiac conditions, including normal and abnormal cases.

## Models Used
1. **ResNet101:**
   - ResNet (Residual Network) architecture with 101 layers was chosen for its deep structure, allowing the model to capture intricate features.

2. **VGG16:**
   - VGG16 architecture, known for its simplicity and effectiveness, was implemented to compare its performance with ResNet101.

## Training
- The models were trained on a subset of the dataset, with proper data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.
- Training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs were fine-tuned for optimal performance.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Model performance was assessed using standard evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

## Results
- Detailed results and performance metrics are provided in the project report or notebook.
- Visualizations, including confusion matrices and accuracy plots, are included to aid in result interpretation.
